## Project title
    MovieMania


## Development
Start the MovieWebsite development asset server and the Express server by running:
    
    npm run dev
This starts your app in development mode, which will purge the server require cache when MovieWebsite rebuilds assets so you don't need a process manager restarting the express server.
## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

    npm i

Then run the app in production mode:

    npm start

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
